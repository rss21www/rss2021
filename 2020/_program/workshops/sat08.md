Autonomous robots must be able make good decisions in the presence of sensor
and outcome uncertainty. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) is the general and principled framework to address such decision
problems. POMDP-based methods have been used widely in robotics, with a number
of successes and failures. The main objective of this workshop is to bring
researchers together to discuss the recent developments in POMDPs and the
remaining open problems that limit their applicability. We will explore if
POMDPs can become an "everyday tool" in robotics. We will discuss the reasons
why this hasn't happened yet and what we can do to overcome these roadblocks.
We will also discuss existing applications of POMDPs in robotics, learn the
"tips and tricks" in applying POMDPs to physical robots, and discuss the gap
between theory and practice. We hope to bring together researchers working on
POMDP-based methods from theory to applications in order to share knowledge and
explore ways to incorporate new methods and identify interesting new problems
to tackle.
