Robotics is undergoing tremendous growth in recent years, over a wide range of
important areas, from transportation, to manufacturing, service, entertainment,
space exploration, healthcare, and education. While the field is progressing
forward, both in academia and industry, the percentage of female roboticists
continues to lag far behind their male counterparts. The third Women in
Robotics Workshop is a mixed-audience, women-only speakers workshop that aims
to: (1) raise visibility of women in robotics, (2) strengthen the community and
provide an opportunity for networking, (3) foster mentorship of junior female
researchers, and ultimately (4) increase the number of women in robotics to
close the gender gap. The workshop features two panels on academic career paths
and robotics entrepreneurship, keynote talks by women who are leaders in their
field, invited talks by early career academics, and poster presentations by
junior researchers selected for travel awards.
