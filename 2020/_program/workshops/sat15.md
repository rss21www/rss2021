Human-centered robotics focuses on the science and systems needed for robots to
interact, assist and cooperate with humans. It is a multifaceted and
challenging domain which entails robot operation in human environments and
close interaction with non-professional users. The workshop aim is to tackle
this topic from multiple perspectives: (i) physiological integration with the
human body; (ii) physical and social interaction with humans; and (iii)
autonomy in dynamic and uncertain environments. There also will be a focus on
assessment tools from each of these disciplines, with the hope of beginning to
synthesize assessment standards for human-centered robotics that draw from
each. The workshop will foster multidisciplinary discussion and a consolidation
of perspectives, methodologies and assessment tools in order to align and
benefit research efforts in human-centered robotics. The program includes
distinguished invited talks, a panel discussion and a poster session.
