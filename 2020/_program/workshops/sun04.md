Recent progress in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has revealed great
opportunities for use of small-scale UAVs in disaster response, environment
monitoring, security and inspection. While reliable GPS-denied localization and
safe, aggressive maneuvering have been successfully demonstrated, closing the
loop between scene understanding and action planning remains an open problem.
Deep learning has emerged as an especially promising way of extracting semantic
meaning suitable for high-level autonomy. Learning techniques achieve the
state-of-the-art performance in object recognition and natural language
processing by replacing hand-engineered features with features that get
automatically extracted from training data. Learning perception and control for
autonomous flight can be approached in much the same way &mdash; by replacing
hand-engineered map representations with raw sensor observations and learning
appropriate responses.

The workshop will bring together researchers from robot planning and control,
reinforcement learning and deep learning, and formal methods to examine the
challenges and opportunities in learning perception and control for safe
high-speed flight in unknown environments. Of particular interest is to
investigate i) how to theoretically analyze the data and structure of learning
systems to provide guarantees on safety and task success, and ii) what is the
effect of long-term memory and, in particular, can recurrent connections or
dynamic external memory replace global map information. The goal is to report
on state-of-the-art approaches, identify open problems, and devise new
principles to meet the challenges faced when applying deep learning to
safety-critical planning tasks that incorporate timing and memory aspects.
