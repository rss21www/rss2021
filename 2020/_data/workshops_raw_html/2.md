With the advent of co-robots acting in direct support of individuals and
groups, fostered by the industry and the National Robotics Initiative, we are
now at the dawn of a new era in which semi-autonomous robots intimately enter
our lives. In such a symbiotic human-robot and bionic world, co-robotic systems
with critical missions will emerge as human mates for medical, educational,
entertainment, and military applications. The paradigm shift induced by this
change in the range of deployment of robots necessitates opening a front to
discuss new problems that do not fit into the conventional frameworks as well
as novel directions expected to help solve existing unresolved problems. The
main objective of this workshop is to discuss new fundamental research
directions and their applications for the next generation of robots. Specific
topics include but are not limited to integration or application of machine
learning and planning in
