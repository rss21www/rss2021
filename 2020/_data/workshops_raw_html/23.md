In this workshop a wide range of renowned experts will discuss deep learning
techniques at the frontier of research that are not yet widely adopted,
discussed, or well-known in our community. We carefully selected research
topics such as Bayesian deep learning, generative models, or deep reinforcement
learning for planning and navigation that are of high relevance and potentially
groundbreaking for robotic perception, learning, and control. The workshop
introduces these techniques to the robotics audience, but also exposes
participants from the machine learning community to real-world problems
encountered by robotics researchers that apply deep learning in their research.

This workshop is the successor of the very successful "Deep Learning in
Robotics" workshop at last year's RSS. Our goal is to bring researchers from
the machine learning and robotics communities together to discuss and contrast
the limits and potentials of new deep learning techniques, as well as propose
directions for future joint research between our communities.
