Most fields of engineering are characterized by fundamental trade-offs between
<i>maximizing</i> performance and <i>minimizing</i> resource usage; robotics is no exception.
In robot design, trade-offs are distributed among subsystems such as sensing,
actuation, computation, and power. A mathematical framework to describe these
trade-offs does not yet exist.

<p>
The speakers and discussions in this workshop will focus on working toward
formal representations that make automated reasoning and synthesis possible,
and enable design choices beyond once-off, <i>ad hoc</i> solutions.  
</p>

<p>
The workshop brings together roboticists, designers and makers with a variety
of backgrounds to start to answer the question: "How can computers and software
help us navigate the space of design decisions?"</p>

<p>
The workshop welcomes contributions about:
</p>

<ol>
<li> practical examples of resource-constrained robots and their performance envelopes;</li>
<li> abstractions and models which have promise as foundations for algorithmic design;</li>
<li> novel and unconventional ideas for how to tame the computational complexities involved.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The intended outcome of the workshop is a better understanding of how informal
and intuitive design decisions, including those exemplified in a custom design
card game — played and discussed after lunch — can be refined and systematized
so as to become fit for automation. The organizers will coordinate with the
speakers a position paper that synthesizes the points of view described in the
workshop. Target journals could be: Robotics &amp; Automation Letters; Nature
Robotics; and Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine.
