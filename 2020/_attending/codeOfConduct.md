Robotics: Science and Systems 2020 is a space for exchanging ideas,
sharing thoughts, engaging in productive debates, creating
professional connections, and learning about exciting robotics
research. We expect all participants to engage in open, respectful
discourse that creates a safe and productive environment for everyone.

RSS 2020 is committed to ensuring all participants have a positive
experience at the virtual conference, and will not tolerate any
harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, disruption, or
bullying. Participants who are asked to stop such behavior are
expected to do so immediately. RSS 2020 may take any action in
response to inappropriate behavior including: warning the offender,
expulsion from the conference with no refund, barring from
participation in future conferences, or reporting the incident to the
offenderâ€™s local institution or funding agencies.

If you have concerns about a participant's behavior, please reach out
to <a href="mailto:rss20hotline@gmail.com">rss20hotline@gmail.com</a> or contact the virtual Help Desk on the conference platform. We will
respond as soon as possible and within 24 hours.
