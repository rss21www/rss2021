The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to: women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities), especially people early in their studies and career. Such efforts are crucial for increasing research capacity, creativity, and broadening the impact of robotics research. To that end, Inclusion @ RSS will be an integral part of RSS that will focus on programs that increase and sustain a broader participation in the robotics research community. Component programs will range from co-located events to sponsored activities during the main conference.

The primary focus of the 2020 Inclusion@RSS will be to increase the number of new conference participants. Comprehensive travel support will be awarded to selected BSc, MSc, and first and second year PhD students. Priority will be given to students who have not previously attended RSS and/or are new to the robotics research community. Applications can be submitted using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZhz4oXKlcxQGmrdbIuvpBxje3jOYWxDBXMfeet4bVG7f9jw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups
traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to:
women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities),
especially people early in their studies and career. To that end, RSS is
providing a special workshops-only registration at a reduced rate ($67.50) for
undergraduates who identify as belonging to an underrepresented group.

To obtain the registration code, please email
[rss2017inclusion@gmail.com](mailto:rss2017inclusion@gmail.com) with your name
and institution name. You will then receive a code to use during registration.
To register, go to the registration site and choose  "Student Registration:
Workshop Only"  and apply the registration code. The code is valid until the
registration website closes on July 5th. Note that when you pick up your badge,
you will need to show proof that you are currently an undergraduate student.
