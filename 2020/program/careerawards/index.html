	<b>Title:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
Perspectives on Machine Learning for Robotics
</p>

	<b>Abstract:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
	Recent advances in machine learning are leading to new tools for designing intelligent robots: functions relied on to govern a robot's behavior can be learned from a robot's interaction with its environment rather than hand-designed by an engineer. Many machine learning methods assume little prior knowledge and are extremely flexible, they can model almost anything! But, this flexibility comes at a cost. The same algorithms are often notoriously data hungry and computationally expensive, two problems that can be debilitating for robotics. 

In this talk I’ll discuss how machine learning can be combined with prior knowledge to build effective solutions to robotics problems. I’ll start by introducing an online learning perspective on robot adaptation that unifies well-known algorithms and suggests new approaches. Along the way, I'll focus on the use of simulation and expert advice to augment learning. I’ll discuss how imperfect models can be leveraged to rapidly update simple control policies and imitation can accelerate reinforcement learning. I will also show how we have applied some of these ideas to an autonomous off-road racing task that requires impressive sensing, speed, and agility to complete.

	<b>Title:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
The Future of Robot Perception: Certifiable Algorithms and Real-time High-level Understanding
</p>

	<b>Abstract:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">

Robot perception has witnessed an unprecedented progress in the last decade. Robots are now able to detect objects and create large-scale maps of an unknown environment, which are crucial capabilities for navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. Despite these advances, both researchers and practitioners are well aware of the brittleness of current perception systems, and a large gap still separates robot and human perception. 
<br />
This talk discusses two efforts targeted at bridging this gap. The first focuses on robustness. I present recent advances in the design of certifiable perception algorithms that are robust to extreme amounts of noise and outliers and afford performance guarantees. I present fast certifiable algorithms for object pose estimation: our algorithms are “hard to break” (e.g., are robust to 99% outliers) and succeed in localizing objects where an average human would fail. Moreover, they come with a “contract” that guarantees their input-output performance. I discuss the foundations of certifiable perception and motivate how these foundations can lead to safer systems.
<br />
The second effort targets high-level understanding. While humans are able to quickly grasp both geometric, semantic, and physical aspects of a scene, high-level scene understanding remains a challenge for robotics. I present our work on real-time metric-semantic understanding and 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs. I introduce the first generation of Spatial Perception Engines, that extend the traditional notions of mapping and SLAM, and allow a robot to build a “mental model” of the environment, including spatial concepts (e.g., humans, objects, rooms, buildings) and their relations at multiple levels of abstraction.
<br />
Certifiable algorithms and real-time high-level understanding are key enablers for the next generation of autonomous systems, that are trustworthy, understand and execute high-level human instructions, and operate in large dynamic environments and over and extended period of time.

<b>Title:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
A Tale of Success and Failure in Robotics Grasping and Manipulation
</p>

<b>Abstract:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">

In 2007, I was a naïve grad student and started to work on vision-based robotic grasping. I had no prior background in manipulation, kinematics, dynamics or control. Yet, I dove into the field by re-implementing and improving a learning-based method. While making some contributions, the proposed method also had many limitations partly due to the way the problem was framed. 

Looking back at the entire journey until today, I find that I have learned the most about robotic grasping and manipulation from observing failures and limitations of existing approaches - including my own. In this talk, I want to highlight how these failures and limitations have shaped my view on what may be some of the underlying principles of autonomous robotic manipulation.

I will emphasise three points. First, perception and prediction will always be noisy, partial and sometimes just plain wrong. Therefore, one focus of my research is on methods that support decision-making under uncertainty due to noisy sensing, inaccurate models and hard-to-predict dynamics. To this end, I will present a robotic system that demonstrates the importance of continuous, real-time perception and its tight integration with reactive motion generation methods. I will also talk about work that funnels uncertainty by enabling robots to exploit contact constraints during manipulation. 

Second, a robot has many more sensors than just cameras and they all provide complementary information. Therefore, one focus of my research is on methods that can exploit multimodal information such as vision and touch for contact-rich manipulation. It is non-trivial to manually design a manipulation controller that combines modalities with very different characteristics. I will present work that uses self-supervision to learn a compact and multimodal representation of visual and haptic sensory inputs, which can then be used to improve the sample efficiency of policy learning. 

And third, choosing the right robot action representation has a large influence on the success of a manipulation policy, controller or planner. While believing many years that inferring contact points for robotic grasping is futile, I will present work that convinced me otherwise. Specifically, this work uses contact points as an abstraction that can be re-used by a diverse set of robot hands.
