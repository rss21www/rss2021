The [RSS Foundation](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org) is the governing body behind the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference.  The foundation was started and is run by [volunteers from the robotics community](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org/index.php/foundation-board) who believe that an [open, high-quality, single-track conference](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org/index.php/rss-papers) is an important component of an active and growing scientific discipline.
