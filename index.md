### Call for Participation

RSS 2020 will be held virtually this year, on July 12-16, 2020. We
invite all roboticists to participate in the live events and
workshops, and use the chance to interact with robotics
scientists around the world.

We will have a central virtual conference platform to host all live
events, allow users to flexibly join workshops and paper discussion
sessions, interact with each other and sponsors, and manage
registration. In addition, all accepted papers and pre-recorded talks
will be freely available on [roboticsconference.org](https://roboticsconference.org) and our [RSS youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeEbAUGjtBlzmqWO5u6VeGg), as
will be recordings of the live plenary talks.

Registration fees will be US$ 20 for students, and US$ 50 for
non-students and give full access to the virtual conference platform,
including the workshop and main conference events.

More detailed information on registration and access to the virtual
conference platform will be announced on [roboticsconference.org](https://roboticsconference.org) by end
of June.


### Live virtual program:

The dissemination and discussion of the newest state-of-the-art
research in robotics is the most important role of RSS. We therefore
let *live discussion sessions of all accepted papers* take the central
part of the RSS virtual program. All participants will have the
opportunity to flexibly joint meeting rooms for each paper and discuss
the work with the authors.

Further, RSS awards excellence in robotics research with the Early
Career Awards, the Best Paper, Best Student Paper, and Best Systems
Paper awards, and -- for the first time this year -- with the Test of
Time Award. The live keynotes and Q&As by the awardees will be the
major focus of our plenary sessions this year.


### Papers & pre-recorded short talks:

All accepted papers and their pre-recorded talks will be available freely on
[roboticsconference.org](https://roboticsconference.org/program/papers/)
prior to the conference. The available material includes:

* papers (once the online proceedings are ready)
* pre-recorded short talks (once they are available on youtube)
* links to supplementary software & videos, if available
* and reviews (optionally)


### Workshops

We have a great set of workshops this year, which will take place on
July 12 & 13. Please see here for a full list:
[workshops](https://roboticsconference.org/program/workshops/)
We aim to make all workshop sessions directly accessible via the
central virtual platform. But please check the individual workshop
pages for more detailed information.

<span style="color:red">The RSS 2020 organizing committee and the RSS foundation boards hope you are safe and well. Due to the pandemic and the uncertainty regarding travel to the US, RSS 2020 will take place **VIRTUALLY** during the original dates (July 12-16). </span>
 
<span style="color:red">The paper review process is on track and we particularly want to thank our reviewers and area chairs for their great service despite the difficult situation. We are planning to send out paper notifications by the beginning of May.</span>

 
<span style="color:red">We expect to share details regarding RSS 2020 by the end of May. The official conference proceedings will be available online, as usual, and we are exploring ways to create an exciting and engaging online program. While we cannot meet physically in one place, let us stay connected as a community and support the open scientific discourse that is the hallmark of RSS. </span>
