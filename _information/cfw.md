The Organizing Committee for the 2020 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (RSS 2020) requests proposals for full and half-day workshops and tutorials to be held on July 12-16, 2020 at Corvallis, OR, USA. Workshop proposals should be submitted on EasyChair <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rss2020-workshops"> here</a>. 

Please contact the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/committees/organizers/">workshop chairs</a> for any clarifications.

The RSS workshops have consistently provided high-quality, topically-focused forums for researchers at the forefront of robotics. This year these events will take place on Sunday, July 12 and Monday, July 13 before the main conference.

Workshops are intended to supplement the primary conference; as such we seek workshops that will provide a complement to the large single-track event.

Specifically, we welcome and will give priority to:

*   Fully elaborated proposals with confirmed, high-quality, diverse invited speakers as well as solicited posters or presentations. Practical demonstrations may also be part of a workshop to show exciting research results.
*   Innovative event structures that will promote discussion and interaction among the participants.
*   Proposals from communities that have not traditionally participated at RSS but are relevant to robotics science, robotics systems, the practice and philosophy of the discipline.
*   Workshops that will encourage analysis and reflection on topics and issues that formulate challenge problems and that promote discussion, debates, and long-term vision.

In addition to traditional workshops, there will be a special “outlier” track that pushes the boundaries of academic workshops by examining ideas that are (i) important for the field, and (ii) poorly treated by the formal peer-review process. The track will explore unconventional formats and topics that eschew current orthodoxy.

## Submissions

We expect proposals to be approximately 2–3 pages in length, and no more than 5 pages.
The proposal template can be found at this link [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7X6axQsE7WpNysRaw7A-aaD9SqW2uB1QgCskfNi46s/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7X6axQsE7WpNysRaw7A-aaD9SqW2uB1QgCskfNi46s/edit?usp=sharing)

Workshop proposals should be submitted on EasyChair at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rss2020-workshops](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rss2020-workshops)

## Important Dates

*  Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: February 16, 2020
*  Acceptance Notification: March 6, 2019
*  Dates: July 12-16 (Main Conference: July 14-16, Workshops: July 12-13), Corvallis, OR, USA
