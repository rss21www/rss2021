We offer several opportunities for sponsors at RSS 2021:

1. Logos on the pre-recorded video presentations for the accepted papers, which will be uploaded publicly.
2. An exhibit (~virtual booth) on the central conference platform with integrated chat and video conferencing tool to interact with RSS attendees, and therefore the opportunity to interact with interested attendees directly.
3. Logos directly on the conference platform and acknowledgements on
roboticsconference.org

Please contact Dylan Shell <dshelll@tamu.edu> if you are interested in supporting RSS 2021.
