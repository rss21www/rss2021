<span style="color:red">As R:SS 2020 will be held as a virtual conference, some of the information below is obsolete. This is the original Call for Papers. (See the original 
[1st CFP](http://duerer.usc.edu/pipermail/robotics-worldwide/2019-December/021346.html)
and
[2nd CFP](http://duerer.usc.edu/pipermail/robotics-worldwide/2020-January/021559.html)
emails.)</span>

We cordially invite you to submit your work to the 2020 Robotics: 
Science and Systems Conference, which will bring together researchers 
working on all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations, 
applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The paper submission 
deadline is on *January 31st, 2020*. The workshop submission deadline is 
on February 6th, 2020.

The conference will be single-track, and the final program will be the 
result of a thorough review process to give attendees an opportunity to 
see the most exciting research in all areas of robotics. Submissions 
will be evaluated in terms of their novelty, technical quality, 
significance, potential impact, and clarity. The program will include 
invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of accepted 
papers. The three-day main session will be preceded by two days of 
workshops.


Highlights of R:SS 2020:

* We put together a great set of Area Chairs that cover all areas of 
robotics. With this we are actively seeking papers broadly in all areas, 
including method oriented as well as application oriented research, 
mechatronics and system design, field robotics, HRI, etc. At submission, 
authors will be able to vote for ACs that they believe can best handle 
their paper during submission. See [here](https://roboticsconference.org/committees/pc/) for the list of ACs.
* The review process will explore a new rebuttal format, with author 
rebuttals being directed to the ACs directly. Anonymous reviews will be 
made public together with accepted papers.
* We will have a Best Paper Award, Best Systems Paper Award, Best 
Student Paper Award, and for the first time a Test of Time Award. The 
Best Systems Paper Award is dedicated to papers that pioneer novel 
robotic systems (e.g. hardware or mechatronics) or novel behaviors on a 
robotic system that are beyond what has been seen before.
* The program will include single track oral and poster presentations of 
all accepted papers, as well as invited talks. The three‐day main 
conference will be preceded by two days of workshops.
* Selected papers will be invited for submission to special issues of 
the International Journal of Robotics Research and Autonomous Robots, 
and for expedited review as regular submissions to the IEEE Transactions 
on Robotics.
